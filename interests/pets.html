    <h1>My Pets</h1>
<p>Rex adopted me 8 years ago. He is about 10 years old and still very much a feral cat. From this picture you would never guess he doesn't care much for other humans.</p>

<p>I have had Penelope for four years now. I am her fourth and final owner. She has had a rough time of it, but she is safe with me now.</p>

<p>Taos is a rescue I got from the Big Mutt Network 3 years ago. She was six months old when I asked my friend Vanessa to bring her over to see if she got along with the rest of my animals. She did and she never left.</p>
