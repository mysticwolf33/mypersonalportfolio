    <h1>Some of my writing and poetry samples</h1>
   
  <p>My California Dreaming poem was written after I took a weeklong roadtrip to Northern California.</p>
    <h3>California Dreaming</h3>
    <pre>
        Dreams fly high as I drive
        But as home draws closer
        Reality crushes them
        Even as the ocean calls
        Pleading for my return
        Can I make it happen?
        Doubts creeping in
        Impossible!
        In the desert I have created
        A sanctuary of my own
        Am I really going to leave it
        To join the piece of
        My heart left behind
        Where crashing waves
        Meet rugged shores

    <p>I wrote this little blurb a couple of years ago after a very frustrating night of sleep</p>
    <h3>Sleeping - A Virtue</h3>
    <p>
        Sleep. Sleep is a habit that has eluded my capture since the moment I was born. My mom told me I used to literally beat my face with my small little fist as I fought falling into the cloud of unconsciousness. I have no idea why I have battled such a blissful activity all of these years. I have never been afraid of my dreams. I have never felt fearful that I would never wake up. I have examined this issue 500 ways from Sunday and the habit is something that I still resist to my despair.
        
        A few years ago, I had a severe concussion that I am still recovering. Vertigo, blurred vision, headaches and momentary confusion are my life now. Sleep keeps the concussion symptoms at bay so it is a habit that is clearly worth cultivating. Yet it remains elusive to this day. I have tried keeping track of it with numerous health and fitness devices: an Apple Watch, an Ōura Ring and now a Garmin Epix Pro Gen 2 Sapphire watch. Today I had a fair score. I actually got a 74 out of 100. Not bad, but I got a notice that said - “Your total sleep was long enough, but you spend a lot of time awake. You’ve had high stress days and poor sleep recently. You may feel very tired today.” Ya think?!? I do feel tired. I feel like I am wading through molasses as I walk down the street to get my daily steps in.
        
        For the life of me I have no idea why I can’t fall asleep or why I can’t stay asleep. Some days I know my animals are the culprit of my problematic sleep. One dog by my right shoulder and the other under my left arm, pinning me so movement is impossible, which really makes it worse because their heat and energy work with my resistance to falling asleep. They growl at me unpleasantly when restlessness causes me to move and interrupt their dreams of chasing cars. Sometimes my cats join the fray by either laying on me or in between my legs, further prohibiting movement. My animals proclivity to be as near to me as possible probably doesn’t help the situation at all. But still, after being on earth for 57 years, sleep is still a habit I am trying to incorporate into my life. I hope someday I finally succeed before the final sleep sends me into the realms of the after world. tdd 2023
