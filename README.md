I am refreshing my html skills after 20 years and this is my working site for a Coursera class provided by UCDavis called Web Development for Beginners. It will improve as I get further into the course. I appreciate this course because of how many hands on excercises are given. It's a great mix of theory and practical. It is however not for strict beginners as the modules setting up Visual Studio Code and GitHub needed a little background technical know how.
