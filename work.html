  <h1>What I Do</h1>  
  <p>I was a senior manager information security for several years. I got laid off and took a position as a senior cybersecurity engineer. Soon after accepting the position, I was in a car accident where I received a mild traumatic brain injury.</p>
  <p>I now have to retrain into another occupation as I have difficulties with the high-stress, rapid-response, and complex short-term memory demands of senior cybersecurity management and engineering. In the baby stages of the web, I used to do some web design. It has been about 20 years since I last did anything with it but I have always been interested in it on the periphery. I have decided to update my skills and am currently taking a Web Development for Beginners class offered by UCDavis via Coursera.</p>
